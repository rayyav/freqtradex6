# Crypto Bot

[Freqtrade](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/) Crypto Bot with [NostalgiaForInfinity](https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity) Strategy.<br>
*The strategy is constantly updated from a Github Action.*

## Getting Started

If not already done, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/)

**Clone repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayyav/freqtradex6.git && cd crypto-bot
```
**Generate the private configuration file**
```bash
cp templates/config.private.json.template user_data/config.private.json
```
**Start Crypto Bot.** *(By default the mode is enabled **Dry-Run**)*
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose up -d
docker compose logs -f.
chown -R 1000:1000 user_data
```
To access FreqUI go to `http://localhost:8080/` and register a new bot with the username and password that indicates the `config.private.json` ***(You can change it at any time)***. In the same file you can activate telegram notifications, configure the exchange credentials and disable dry-run mode.


## Automatically Update Crypto Bot

```bash
cp templates/update-crypto-bot.sh.template scripts/update-crypto-bot.sh
cd ${HOME}/crypto-bot/scripts
# In update-crypto-bot.sh, add TG_TOKEN, TG_CHAT_ID and confirm the CRYPTO_BOT_PATH (Path where you cloned your project)
chmod -x active-crontab.sh && ./active-crontab.sh
```


## Backtesting

If not already done, install Make: `sudo apt install make`<br>
*Note: All parameters are optional, I could see their default value in the [Makefile](https://github.com/kerycdiaz/crypto-bot/blob/main/Makefile)*

**Download the pairs you need to perform backtesting**
```bash
make download-data EXCHANGE=binance TIMERANGE=20220101-20220201 TIMEFRAME='5m'
```

**Know the downloaded pairs and their temporality**
```bash
make list-data EXCHANGE=binance
```

**Running backtesting for a defined strategy**
```bash
make backtesting EXCHANGE=binance STRATEGY=SampleStrategy TIMERANGE=20220101-20220201 TIMEFRAME='5m'
```

***If you want to backtest the `NostalgiaForInfinityX` strategy you must download the data for `'5m 15m 1h 1d'`***
